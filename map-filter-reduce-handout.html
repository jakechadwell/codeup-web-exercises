//~ * Map * ~

//TODO Together: Let's see a common approach we might have done in the past: our goal is to increase each element of an array by 1 [element + 1], then get an array back with those values

var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
var evens = [];
for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i += 1) {
    if (numbers[i] % 2 === 0) {
        evens.push(numbers[i]);
    }
}
console.log(evens); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

//TODO Together: Now, let's achieve the same result with the first part of our lesson: the MAP method~

//TODO Together: Let's get all these restaurant names out of this array of objects with .map()!

//TODO: Create your own array of (up to 3 and at least 2) restaurant objects building off of the basic list you created during the MapBox exercise (or build one anew!) ~5 mins

const favRestaurants = [
    {
        name: 'Pho District',
        location: '2401 W 7th St, Fort Worth, TX',
        dishes: 'Pho'
    },
    {
        name: 'Velvet Taco',
        location: '2700 W 7th St, Fort Worth, TX',
        dishes: 'Tacos'
    },
    {
        name: 'Chipotle',
        location: '3000 W 7th St Ste 110, Fort Worth, TX',
        dishes: 'Burritos and Bowls'
    }
];

//TODO: Now, having created a personal array of restaurant objects for yourself, use .map() to get your favorite restaurant's names out of that collection, into another array, and out into the console! ~5 mins

const names = favRestaurants.map(n => n.name);
console.log(names);

//~ * Filter * ~

//TODO Together: Once again, let's take a look at the old way we might approach an issue: getting only one type of values out of an array (for example: even numbers only from an array of nums!)

//TODO Together: Now, let's refactor the above using the ES6 .filter() method with the same goal: even numbers only!

//TODO Together: Using my favoriteRestaurants list, let's filter out all of the non-buffet restaurants


//TODO: Each one of your restaurant arrays is unique, but, in that array, identify something to filter by - it could be as simple as "well, let me filter out all of the restaurants with names shorter than 8 characters" or get as complicated as you'd like!

//TODO: Once you've done the above, go ahead and write the necessary code to achieve what you wanted - remember to practice with .filter() and our ES6 verbiage!


const filter = favRestaurants.filter(n => n.name.split(" ").length === 1)
console.log(filter);
//~ * Reduce * ~

//Reduce is an interesting animal in and of itself: it's a way to reduce a collection down to, typically, a single value of some kind:

//TODO Together: Let's sum up some numbers with the .reduce() method and a number array!


//TODO Together: That's pretty wild, eh! Wonder what else we could get up to with .reduce() - how about we make a function and use .reduce() inside of it? We'll write a function named countWords that takes a sentence in a single string. We need to split that sentence into an array and then write a .reduce() that would let us know how many times each word appeared in the string.


//TODO Together: Pretty good, but do we want to count the number of times the comma is involved? If only we had a method that would .filter() - wait! Let's refactor the above function to do just that!



//TODO: Let's make a new array of objects to use - make an array of objects [{},{},{}] consisting of a number of family members as objects with their name and ages as properties. Use .reduce() to sum up the age of those family members and see what it is! e.g. [{name: "Thurston Howell III", age: 50}, {name: "William Dean Howells", age: 83}] would be 133 by adding those two age properties together (50 + 83).

let familyMembers = [
    {
        name: 'Dad',
        age: 59
    },
    {
        name: 'Mom',
        age: 48
    },
    {
        name: 'Johnson',
        age: 28
    },
    {
        name: 'Dennis',
        age: 27
    }
];

const ageSum = familyMembers.reduce((total, person) => {
    return total + person.age
}, 0);
console.log(ageSum);
